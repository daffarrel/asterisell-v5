Asterisell-5.6-beta
-------------------
:date: 2016-12-21

Switched from commercial license, to GPL License, and to a new `GitHub repo <https://github.com/massimo-zaniboni/asterisell-v5>`_, for public accessible downloads.

Asterisell Management Utility was simplified, but now it supports only instances on local Docker containers, and not any more remote virtual machines.

The application manual is not any more based on Redmine Wiki, but it is based on `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_.

Minor improvements to the source code.

.. important::
   This version is in beta status because there are is not yet a lot of experience in production
   about Asterisell Docker instances, and there can be management defects to solve.
