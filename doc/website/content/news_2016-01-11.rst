This version fix a serious bug related to rating of Services. In case you are using services, you must:
* open exactly one service on Services->Services menu,
* change its name adding one character like "a" in the name, for forcing a modification, and save it,
* editing again, removing the "a" and saving again for restoring the correct status.

Doing this, Services will be inspected again, and the correct meta-info will be added to them.
