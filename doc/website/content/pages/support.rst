Open source development
-----------------------

Asterisell is released under GPL3+ license: `Asterisell GitHub Repository`_. 

The development is usually driven by customer requests, and it is done inside private reports, for not exposing confidential information. But at the end of the work, all improvements are back-ported to the OSS version, except obviously private configurations of the customers.

Current status
--------------

Asterisell is used in production from 2009, so it is stable. 

Main features of the application are tested by unit tests, but new releases can introduce unexpected problems on minor features.
