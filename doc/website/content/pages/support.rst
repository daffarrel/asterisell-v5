Open source development
-----------------------

Asterisell is released under GPL3+ license. The development is usually driven by customer requests, and it is done inside private repositories, for not exposing confidential information. But at the end of the work, all improvements are back-ported to the OSS version, except obviously private configurations of the customers.

Current status
--------------

Asterisell is used in production from 2009, so it is stable. 

Main features of the application are tested by unit tests, but new releases can introduce unexpected problems on minor features.

Asterisell is not anymore supported for new users, but only for current customers already using it.
