  id: [reference]
  # a short internal reference name, used also in debug sessions for
  # discovering which rate is applied to a CDR.

  #
  # Specify on which CDRs the rate is applicable
  #

  # All these matches are optionals.

  match-communication-channel: [list of communication channel types]
  # if the CDR match one of the channels in the list, this rate can be applied.
  # It can be used for calculating incomes, if the end-customer knows in advance
  # the used communication-channel.
  # Usually this is an internal information of the VoIP provider, so it is fair
  # using this only for calculating costs.

  match-vendor: [list of vendors]
  # if the CDR match one of the vendors in the list, this rate can be applied.
  # A vendor is a VoIP provider used from a reseller for routing the calls.
  # This can not be used (usually) for calculating incomes, because an end-customer
  # does not know the vendor used, and he is not responsible for this.
  # So it is usually used only for calculating costs.

  match-price-category: [list of price categories]
  # see notes on &quot;Rates-&gt;Price Categories&quot; section, on how to model hierarchical price categories.

  match-call-direction: [outgoing|incoming|internal|system]

  match-telephone-number: [list of telephone numbers]
  # The external telephone number:
  #   * the called telephone number for outgoing and internal calls,
  #   * the calling telephone number for incoming calls.
  #
  # Telephone numbers are expressed in the same format used for specifying internal extensions,
  # so something like &quot;123,123X,123X*,123*,123\X\*&quot;,
  # where &quot;X&quot; stays for any character,
  #       &quot;*&quot; stays for zero or more characters.
  # &quot;\\\\&quot; is the quotation for the &quot;\\&quot; character.
  # &quot;\,&quot; is the quotation for the &quot;,&quot; character
  # &quot; 123, 456&quot; is parsed into extensions &quot;123&quot;, and &quot;456&quot;
  # &quot; 123, 4 5 6&quot; is parsed into extensions &quot;123&quot;, and &quot;4 5 6&quot;
  # &quot;\ 123, \ 456&quot; is parsed into extensions &quot; 123&quot;, and &quot; 456&quot;
  #
  # NOTE: in case of a list of many telephone numbers, it is best using CSV files, and external-rate references.

  match-rating-code: [list of rating codes]
  # match if the external telephone number (maybe ported) is associated to an entry
  # in the telephone prefix table, with the specified rating-code.
  # In many cases a rating-code represent the telephone operator owning/responsible
  # for the external telephone number.
  # It is useful for assigning common codes to various telephone prefixes with a common property,
  # and then using (simpler) rules matching only the rating-code instead of all the telephone prefixes.
  #
  # This can be used for rating also incomes, because customers are informed of the called telephone number.

  match-peak-code: [list of peak codes]
  # match if the call time respect one of the listed peak-codes.
  # Peak-codes are defined in the &quot;Params -&gt; Holiday table&quot;.
  #
  # Peak codes that are one the opposite of the other can be specified defining only one of the two,
  # and using rates with an &quot;else&quot; part for matching the opposite peak-code.
  #
  # Peak-code can be used for rating also incomes, because customers should be informed of their rating plan,
  # and they know the call time.

  #
  # Specify how to calculate the cost of the call
  #

  # NOTE: Sets must be always specified after the match part.

  # These are the tranformations that can be applied on the
  # billable duration of a call.
  # The tranformations are applied in the specified order,
  # so also the order of specification is mandatory.
  # If a parameter is not specified, the default value is assumed.

  set-free-seconds: [number of seconds]
  # do not apply the cost-for-minute to these first seconds.
  # 0 is the default value.

  set-duration-discrete-increments: [number of seconds]
  # rate every specified seconds.
  # 0 is the default value.
  #
  # If the specified value is for example 3,
  # then a call with duration 0,1,2 is considered as 3 second,
  # a call with duration 3,4,5 is considered as 6 seconds, and so on.

  set-at-least-seconds: [number of seconds]
  # consider the call at least as the specified seconds

  # These are the tranformations that are applied to the cost of a call.
  # The tranformations are applied in the specified order,
  # so also the order of specification is mandatory.
  # If a parameter is not specified, the default value is assumed.

  set-cost-on-call: [1.0|imported|expected]
  # the initial cost of the call (default value is 0)
  # &quot;imported&quot; is used for CDRS imported from external sources, having already the cost/income calculated
  # &quot;expected&quot; is used for CDRS imported from external sources/providers, and force the usage of the expected cost field

  set-cost-for-minute: [1.0]
  # the cost of the call,
  # specified for every minute, otherwise the value is too low to specify,
  # but applied by default for every second of call.
  # (default value is 0)

  set-max-cost-of-call: [1.0]
  # apply this cost, if the calculated cost of the call is major than this

  set-min-cost-of-call: [1.0]
  # apply this cost, if the calculated cost of the call is less that this

  set-round-to-decimal-digits: [integer]
  # round the cost of the call to the specified digits.
  # For example 2.41, 2.44 became 2.4, and 2.45, 2.48 became 2.5, when rounding to the 1st decimal digit.
  # If left unspecified, use the maximum possible precision, without any rounding.

  set-ceil-to-decimal-digits: [integer]
  # ceil the cost of the call to the specified decimal digits.
  # For example both 2.41, 2.44, 2.48, became 2.5 when ceiling to the 1st decimal digit.
  # If left unspecified, use the maximum possible precision, without any rounding.
  # This operation is done after the round operation.
  # So it is possible round to 4 digit, and ceiling later to 3 digits.

  set-floor-to-decimal-digits: [integer]
  # floor the cost of the call to the specified decimal digits.
  # For example both 2.41, 2.44, 2.48, became 2.4, when flooring to the 1st decimal digit.
  # If left unspecified, use the maximum possible precision, without any rounding.
  # This operation is done after the ceil operation.

  rate {
    # A child rate, inherits all the sets and matches of its parent rate, and it can override them.
    # Rates can be arbitrary nested, in order to grouping rates by common characteristics.
    # For avoiding ratinng errors, if a rate has one ore more children, then one and only one of its children
    # must match the CDR with stronger priority, and it will be used for rating the CDR.
    # If there are two or more matching rates, then an error is signaled.
    # If no children match the CDR, then an error is signaled.

    id: [reference]
    # this can be a short id, because the complete rate reference name will
    # contain automatically also the parent id.
    # For example &quot;root/outgoing/emergency-telephone-numbers&quot; is a complete path of ids,
    # where the single id parts are &quot;root&quot; for the id of the initial root rate,
    # &quot;outgoing&quot; is the id of the first nested rate, and &quot;emergency-telephone-numbers&quot; is
    # the id of the final nested rate. If the final nested rate is applied to a CDR,
    # then the signaled applied rate is &quot;root/outgoing/emergency-telephone-numbers&quot;.
    # So there can be repeated &quot;id&quot; names in nested rates, because only the full
    # path id must be unique.

  # So it is always selected the children rate with the longest matching telephone number.

  # In case of two children rates matching a telephone number with the same strength, a rating error is signaled

    set-cost-on-call: [this|parent|specific-value]
    # Use &quot;this&quot; for using the value returned from the called external rate (usually a CSV file).
    # Use &quot;parent&quot; if the value is not in the CSV file, and the value of the parent rate must be used.
