## Open source development

Asterisell is released under GPL3+ license.

There is no distinction between commercial and free version. It is all free
except private customization that can expose confidential information of
Asterisell users. But all improvements to the application are
back-ported to the OSS repository.

## Current status

Asterisell is used in production from 2007.

Asterisell v5 is used in production from 2015, and it can be considered
a stable and tested application.

Every new release can introduce unexpected but temporary problems. Read
the [Asterisell News](https://www.asterisell.com/news.html) section for
knowing which parts are changed.
