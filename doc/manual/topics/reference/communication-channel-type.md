# Communication channel type

Different [communication-channel]s can have common types (e.g. fixed-line, mobile-calls, enum-calls, SIP-calls).

The [communication-channel-type] can be used:

  - for calculating the cost/income of a [cdr]
  - for grouping CDRs of the same type in on-line and off-line reports
