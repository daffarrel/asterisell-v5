# Customized file

A customized file is a file put into ``customizations`` directory, and not shared with other users of Asterisell, and not present in the OSS repository. It contains instance-specific customizations.

Usually a functionality is implemented in a generic way in Asterisell, and then the customized file contains only the few instance specific settings/behaviour.

The customized file had to be loaded on the [asterisell-host] by explicit settings in [instances-configuration-file].
