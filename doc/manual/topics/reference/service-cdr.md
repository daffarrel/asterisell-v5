# Service CDR

A pseudo-CDR generated from Asterisell, and not associated to a real VoIP call, representing the income of a bundle-rate or of a pure service (e.g. rent of lines and so on). 

It is useful to see it like a normal CDR, because it can be displayed in reports, and sent to [reseller], but in some cases it will be treated in a special way, because it is not a real VoIP call.
