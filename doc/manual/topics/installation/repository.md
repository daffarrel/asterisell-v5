# Download Asterisell 

Asterisell is installed downloading the source-code directory from its repository.


Use the command

```
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/massimo-zaniboni/asterisell-v5
```

Asterisell uses Git <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git\_(software)> also upgrading, because:

  - only the incremental changes are transferred
  - private customizations and configurations can be merged with default
    application upgrades, using common Git techniques
