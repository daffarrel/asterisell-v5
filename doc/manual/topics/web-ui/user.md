## Web Accounts

A Web Account is a user having access via email and web to the calls and reports of an organization.

There can be one or more accounts associated to an organization, or to some parts of it.

For example there can be a Web Account for every telephone number of the organization, who can receive reports with only his calls.

An organization has also in the party

There can be Web Accounts playing the role of organization accountant, receiving the invoices, or other call traffic analysis reports.

## Sending of Invoices

Official/Legal Documents (invoices and so on...) are sent by default also to the legal email associated to the organization/customer. So they are sent to an organization also if there is no associated Web Account.

## Differences between Organizations and Web Accounts

A Customer or Organization is some entity "owning" the calls. It can be a physical person or some legal entity.

A Web Account is a physical person, having some permissions on the data of some organization.

On the same organization, there can be one or more active Web Accounts, with different rights.

## History of Changes

Web Account does not maintain an history of changes made on their data. Only the current info is applicable to a Web Account.

So if a Web Account can not view anymore calls of a certain organization, he can not view also the calls in the past, when he had this permission.

This behaviour is not a limitation of the application, but the usual behaviour for managing users.
