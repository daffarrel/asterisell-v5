# Party

A Party contains all the fiscal informations about vendors, customers, users, and organizations.

## Effect of changes

If you change information associated to a Party, and you re-generate reports then the new information
will be used, instead of the old information. There is no history of Party changes, and the most recent
information will always be used.

## Undo changes

If you change some data in a wrong way, the ``Backup of Organizations`` form can be used for retriving old versions of the data.
