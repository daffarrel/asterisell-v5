# Root organizations

Customers can have an hierarchical structure: departments, offices, users, and so on. 
Each part can be billed separately, if the corresponding party is of type "billable".

Every part of an organization can have many users with different roles. Users can view calls, receive reports, and so on, according their roles.

## Changes

Organizations can change their hierarchy structure with time. The structure of the past is not lost, and calls are always rated according the organization hiearchy of the date of the call.

Fiscal information and users will mantain only the last edited data.

## Undo of changes

Old version of an organization can be retrieved from ``Entities -> Backup``.
