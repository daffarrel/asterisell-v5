In this directory there are files that are used during initial installation,
or for regression tests.

These files are not loaded at run-time, from the application, but only
during the initial installation phase, otherwise too much code is loaded for serving requests,
during normal application execution.

So there is an explicit include in "asterisell.php" management console.
