Asterisell Managed/Configured Instances

Every instance run on a distinct Docker Container.

The Docker container is created according the content of

  fabric_data/config_files_templates/docker/Dockerfile

You can change it, also if it is not suggested.

NOTE: Docker is not used in the suggested way, because all the services
(database, http server, and so on) run on the same container.

The container is accessed from Fabric management tool using an ssh server.

Logs are regularly rotated.

Backups are managed from Asterisell jobs.

Every instance is configured using a Python class. The hope is that
Python is simple and readable enough, for being used like a configuration
language. Python classes are used as a template for defining objects
with common configurations.

This file is already configured with some DEMO instance.
